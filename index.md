# 'Tidy' Data

## Best practices for storing data
- Each variable forms a column
- Each observation forms a row
- Each observational unit forms a table

From Hadley Wickham's ['Tidy Data', 2014](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10)

## Project Organization
## Or, 'keepin' it all together'!
- Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
- Put text documents associated with the project in the **doc** directory.
- Put raw data and metadata in the **data** directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a results directory.
- Put source for the projectâ€™s scripts and programs in the **src** directory
- Name all files to reflect their content or function.

See an example folder structure below:

Data Management 
- saving both raw and intermediate forms; documenting all steps; creating tidy data amenable to analysis.
- d;l

- Software: writing, organizing, and sharing scripts and programs used in an analysis.
- Collaboration: making it easy for existing and new collaborators to understand and contribute to a project.
- Project Organization: organizing the digital artifacts of a project to ease discovery and understanding.
- Tracking Changes: recording how various components of your project change over time.
- Manuscripts: writing manuscripts in a way that leaves an audit trail and minimizes manual merging of conflict.

# Python Solutions
## Package Installation on Windows

First thing's first: before installing any packages, [create a new environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html), so you don't inadvertently mess up the root environment. It's a good thing to always a clean root you're always able to access, should something go wrong down the road.

To install a needed package try:

```
1. conda install package
2. pip install package
3. easy_install package
```
